# QuantumSentinel

## GenAI-Powered Intrusion Detection System

* * *

## Introduction

QuantumSentinel is a Generative AI–powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) developed as a major academic project. It is designed to detect, analyze, and explain suspicious and malicious network activities in real time. By combining machine learning techniques with Generative AI, the system improves detection accuracy and provides meaningful insights into potential security threats.

## Problem Statement

Traditional intrusion detection systems mainly rely on static rules and signature-based detection. These systems struggle to detect zero-day attacks and evolving threats, often resulting in high false-positive rates. There is a need for an intelligent, adaptive intrusion detection system that can identify unknown threats and provide contextual explanations for security events.

## Objectives

*   To monitor network traffic in real time
    
*   To detect malicious activities using machine learning models
    
*   To reduce false positives compared to traditional IDS
    
*   To use Generative AI for explaining detected threats
    
*   To provide a scalable and secure intrusion detection solution
